NOSTRSUITE PERMISSIONLESS ALTERNATIVE

The purpose of this exploratory project is to create a distributed version control system that uses a MerkleDAG-based data structure to track changes to code and files. The system leverages the Storj network as a decentralized file storage system for collaboration. The MerkleDAG-based data structure ensures that all changes are tracked in a cryptographically verifiable manner, while Storj provides a highly secure storage layer for files.

FUNCTIONALITY

This permissionless alternative to centralized systems like GitHub provides users with a decentralized system to share and collaborate on open-source projects. The system features a MerkleDAG-based data structure for tracking changes to code and files, integration with the Storj network for decentralized file storage, a simple and intuitive command-line interface for managing repositories and collaborating with others, and resilient storage of files.

CONTRIBUTING AND INSTALLATION

To contribute to the project, clone the repository from the GitHub page by clicking on the green "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP." After the ZIP file is downloaded, extract it to a folder on your device. To install the necessary dependencies, navigate to the folder and run the following command in the command-line interface:

Copy code
npm install
This will install all the necessary dependencies and allow you to begin working with the system. Please note that you will need to create a storj-credentials.json file with your Storj account credentials in order to upload and download files to the network.

FILE STRUCTURE

The following files are included in the repository:

index.html - This file contains the HTML code for the landing page of the system.
styles.css - This file contains the CSS code for styling the HTML elements of the system.
scripts.js - This file contains the JavaScript code for the system's functionality, utilizing the Storj library and the MerkleDAG-based data structure.
