"NOSTRSUITE" - ONGOING EXPLORATION

This is an exploatory effort toward the creation of a distributed version control system that utilizes a MerkleDAG-based data structure to track changes to code + files, and leverages the Storj network as a decentralized file storage system for collaboration.

The MerkleDAG-based data structure ensures that all changes are tracked in a cryptographically verifiable manner, while Storj provides a highly secure and resilient storage layer for files.

PURPOSE

The purpose of this project is to provide a secure, decentralized system for users to share and collaborate on open-source projects without relying on centralized service.

FEATURES

MerkleDAG-based data structure for tracking changes to code and files.
Integration with the Storj network for decentralized file storage.
Simple and intuitive command-line interface for managing repositories and collaborating with others.
Highly secure and resilient storage of files.
Open source and community-driven development.

CONTRIBUTING & INSTALLATION

Clone the repository: users can do this by going to the repository page on GitHub, clicking on the green "Code" button, and selecting "Download ZIP". Once the ZIP file is downloaded, users can extract to a folder on their device.
